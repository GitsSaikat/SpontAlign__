Subtle gradients or sophisticated color transitions (optional).
Focus on clarity and conveying intelligence/trustworthiness.
Personality: Innovative, Forward-Thinking, Intelligent, Credible, Transparent, Collaborative.
4. Technology Stack:
Frontend Framework: Next.js (Leverage its benefits for performance, SEO, and potentially server-side rendering or static generation where appropriate).
5. Site Structure & Pages:
The website requires the following distinct pages/sections:
Homepage: Engaging introduction, summarizing key areas (Vision, Research highlights, Products/Enterprise sneak peek), clear calls-to-action.
Our Vision: Detail the company's mission, long-term goals, core values, and the problems SpontAlign aims to solve.
Research: Showcase research papers, projects, methodologies, publications, and potentially key researchers. Needs structure for easy browsing (e.g., filter by topic/year).
Enterprise: Focus on B2B offerings, solutions, potential use cases, and how SpontAlign partners with businesses.
Products: Detail specific AI products or platforms developed by SpontAlign (if applicable). Could be combined with Enterprise if offerings overlap significantly.
Mentorship: Information about mentorship programs, academic collaborations, or community engagement initiatives.
Docs: Technical documentation for APIs, products, or research frameworks. Needs clear navigation and search functionality.
Blogs: Articles, insights, company news, thought leadership pieces. Needs categorization and potentially author information.
Contact Us: Contact form, physical address (if applicable), email addresses, potentially a map.
6. Key Design & Functional Requirements:
Header/Navigation:
Persistent Header: A clean header visible on all pages. It can be sticky or appear on scroll.
Logo Placement: The SpontAlign company logo must be prominently placed in the header, typically on the left, and should link back to the Homepage. Ensure the logo used has a transparent background.
Primary Navigation: Clear links to the main pages (Vision, Research, Enterprise, etc.). Consider dropdowns for sections like Research or Docs if they become extensive.
Footer:
Include standard footer elements: Copyright notice, privacy policy link, terms of service link, secondary navigation (optional), social media links.
Background Treatment - Postmodern Aesthetic:
The overall page backgrounds should incorporate a postmodern aesthetic.
This will be achieved by allowing user-provided images to be integrated into the background layer.
Implementation: Design the layout so that content sections (text, cards, etc.) sit cleanly on top of these background visuals. The background might involve:
Layering of images or textures.
Geometric shapes derived from or interacting with the images.
Subtle parallax scrolling effects.
Fragmented or collage-like arrangements behind the main content areas.
Crucially: The postmodern background elements must not compromise readability or usability. They should add visual interest and depth without overwhelming the clean, Meta/Anthropic-inspired foreground UI.
Button Interactivity:
All primary buttons and potentially key interactive elements must have two distinct animation states:
Hover State: A subtle visual change on mouse hover (e.g., slight background color shift, gentle scale-up, border appearing/changing, icon movement).
Active/Press State: A clear visual feedback when the button is clicked/pressed (e.g., slightly inset look, faster color flash, minor scale-down).
Animations should be smooth, quick, and consistent across the site.
Typography:
Select clean, modern, highly legible sans-serif fonts. Define a clear typographic hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, body text, captions).
Color Palette:
Develop a palette that aligns with the Meta/Anthropic aesthetic (e.g., deep blues, grays, white/off-white) but is unique to SpontAlign. Include primary, secondary, and accent colors. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility.
Imagery & Icons:
Use high-quality, relevant imagery (beyond the background images).
Employ clean, minimalist icons consistent with the overall aesthetic.
Responsiveness:
Fully responsive design that adapts flawlessly to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Mobile-first approach recommended.
Performance & SEO:
Optimize for fast load times (image optimization, code splitting via Next.js).
Implement SEO best practices (semantic HTML, meta tags, etc.).
7. Deliverables (Conceptual):
High-fidelity mockups/prototypes for key pages.
Style guide (colors, typography, iconography, button states).
Developed Next.js website codebase.
